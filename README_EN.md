# Steam Bulk Block Users (Tampermonkey Script)

## Features

This script adds a button on Steam user pages to **bulk block all friends of that user** with one click.

**Main features:**

* One-click bulk blocking with real-time progress display.
* Can cancel the operation midway.
* Automatically handles request retries and timeouts.
* Clean UI with progress display and estimated remaining time (mostly fancy).

⚠️ **Note**: This operation is irreversible. Once a user is blocked, you need to unblock them manually.
